## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are deadlink reports or newlinks requests. Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** We get a lot of duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue.
2. **Share as much information as possible.**



## Pull requests

- The link should be added to a proper list.
- The link being added to the bookmark in a different source. Not the same source repeated.
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes - keep them simple and small.
- Updating with the latest changes
- Always work on a branch. Merge it with master.
- Pull requests should always be against the `master` branch, never against `gh-pages`.


## Coding standards
- Indent with 4 spaces.Never tabs.
- Use unix line endings.
- Always a space after a property's colon.
